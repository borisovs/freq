Netflix has revealed when season 3 of Squid Game will be released on the streaming service: June 27, 2025. Netflix used its 2025 Preview event to show off a sneak peek at the highly anticipated third season, releasing photos of the competitors in the deadly games.

It comes after Netflix announced season 3 only days after the release of Squid Game season 2. Netflix posted on X on New Year's Eve about the third installment of the hugely popular show about a deadly Korean game. An image included in the post features the red light, green light doll, Young-hee, next to a male doll called Chul-su.

The second season ended on a cliff-hanger, with the episode Friend or Foe setting the scene for the final conflict, which will play out in the final season. It sounds like you won't have to wait long to discover what happens next, but there's something you can watch now (just in case you missed it): the Squid Game season 2 post-credits scene.
